    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <img src="../Images/eggs.jpg" alt="Oh no where is egg?!?!" width="400px" height="400px">
    <p>A very popular breakfast staple in America, second only to bacon</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Eggs (Duh)</li>
    <li>1 TBSP Butter</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Crack the eggs in a bowl whisking thoroughly, bonus points if its a giant bowl with an actual whisk</li>
     <li>Heat pan over medium to medium high heat, droplets of water should dance around the pan</li>
     <li>Add the butter to the pan, ideally it shouldn't be brown by the time the eggs are in</li>
     <li>Add eggs using a rubberized spatula to move the eggs around the pan to avoid overcooking</li>
     <li>Continue shuffling the eggs around until almost all liquid is solid, remove from heat</li>
     <li>At this point using the residual heat, solidify the remaining liquid and then serve</li>
     <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please do not try to "fry" the eggs, they should be tender.</p>
