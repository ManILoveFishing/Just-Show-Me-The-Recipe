    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g-1kg Any style potato</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Slice all potatoes into whatever uniform shape you'd like (cubed, shoestring, wedges etc.)</li>
    <li>simmer in a pot of water on low to low-medium for a few minutes, checking frequently</li>
    <li>stick a knife or fork through, should retain its shape but give without crumbling like cold butter</li>
    <li>strain and toss in a bowl with the oil and salt until combined</li>
    <li>Ideally lay them out on a baking pan lined with wax paper or foil, deeper pans work too</li>
